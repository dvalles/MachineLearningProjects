"""
Recent studies using RNA sequencing have found there are at least 24 types of excitory
neurons, 45 types of inhibitory neurons, and 6 non neuron cell types in the human brain
In the human brain, most cell types are found at each laminar level

Two main cell types are glial cells and neurons,
main glial cells are astrocytes and oligodendrocytes

Astrocytes help with energy supply, blood brain barrier control, neuro and synapto genesis

Oligodentrocytes manage myelin sheathing

"""
Your neurons are made up of dendrites, the main body, axons, and the axon terminal
The layout of these change somewhat depending on the type of neuron (motor cell, sensory cell, etc)

Dendrites recieve electrochemical signals from previous neurons through synapses
The body of the neuron controls the activation potential through a constantly changing membrane potential
The axon channels the activation potential once fired, it is the only part with myelin sheathing (from oligodendrocytes)
And the axon terminal is the counterpart to the dendrite
